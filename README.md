# Portfolio
This is a working work-in-progress portfolio. It has a scrolling effect when you click the nav bar and it also has a 
few lighting effects when hovering over my skills and resume. Last but not least it has a light and dark mode that is also a work-in-progress but will only improve with time. Along with my first project which I am not super happy with but will also be enhanced over time, along with new ones to come.
